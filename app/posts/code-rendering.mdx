# Code Rendering

In future blog posts, I want to render code snippets. After playing around with some MDX plugins, I think I finally settled on one.

## Rehype Syntax Highlighting

[Rehype-pretty-code](https://rehype-pretty.pages.dev/) is an MDX plugin that adds syntax higlighting to your code blocks.
You can also highlight certain lines and show line numbers.

For example, here's a function that calculates a sum of a list of numbers. I've highlighted the for-loop section.

```ts {3-5} showLineNumbers
function sum(nums: number[]): number {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let num of nums) {
    sum += num;
  }
  return sum;
}
```

Not bad. I like this high contrast style. I really like how I can show the line numbers and highlight multiple lines. I'll definitely be using this from here on out.

(Btw, during my research, I learned about [CSS counters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_counter_styles/Using_CSS_counters). Was this always a thing? This seems pretty useful!)
